<b><em>December 1941</em></b>
<br>
<b>The brutal winter conditions have stalled all actions of the rampaging Wehrmacht just short of Moscow.
<br>Stalin has organized Russian elite troops from Siberia in preparation for a massive counterattack.
<br>Japan is determined to rule the Pacific and gain access to the resources needed by force.
<br>The Imperial Fleet has maneuvered undetected and is now in position to attack Pearl Harbor.
<br>Roosevelt eager to enter the war for the Allies, will get his Casus Belli at the cost of thousands of American sailors lives.
<br>China is fighting for its very survival in desperate hopes of repelling the Japanese occupation of its homeland.
<br>Italy is determined to restore a Romanesque dominion in the Mediterranean Sea and Africa, while British forces struggle to try
<br>to hold on to their territories across the globe.
<br>The events in December 1941 turn the scattered regional conflicts into a Total World War for the 2nd time.</b>

<br><b>Minor Nations (those in brackets like Finland) have their own territories which generate income and production, but their forces are transferred, controlled and moved by their associated Major power (Germany).</b>
<br><b>This creates a unique gameplay experience where the Major powers have limited ability to exploit production capacity in far flung regions that were underdeveloped and were limited to the use of their own local resources.</b>
